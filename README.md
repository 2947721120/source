File Icons
==========

This is the source for the [File-Icons](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) package's custom icon-font.

**NOTE:** Don't request icon additions here. Please do that at the [proper repository](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons/issues/).



Adding new icons
----------------
Currently, [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) is used to generate the icon-font.

To add new icons, repeat the following steps:

1. Open [IcoMoon's projects panel](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects), and select **Import Project**.
2. Select `icomoon.json`, located in this repo's base directory.
3. Click the imported project's **Load** button.
4. Press the â˜° icon near the top-right corner. In the menu that opens, click **Import to Set**. 
5. Select one or more SVG files.
6. Select each imported icon, then press **Generate Font**.
7. Press **Download**.
8. Move the downloaded ZIP folder to this repo's base directory.
9. Run `make` from command-line to extract the files to the right locations.

Windows users may need to install [GOW](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) if they don't have Make installed.


Requirements when adding icons
------------------------------
Before submitting a pull request, make sure you've followed these steps:

1. Always include newly-added SVGs in your fork's `svg` folder.
2. Fit icons to a square canvas when possible. More info on that [here](https://github.com/Alhadis/DevOpicons#size-fixes).
3. Don't add icons that're already included in one of the existing icon-fonts bundled with the package:
	* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/)
	* [DevOpIcons](https://github.com/Alhadis/DevOpicons)
	* [MFixx](https://github.com/Alhadis/MFixx)
